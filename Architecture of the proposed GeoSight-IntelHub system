o	Vehicles with GPS and video feed capabilities: These are the sources of your raw data. Each vehicle would have a unique identifier (device_id).

                                                    V
o	Data Ingestion Layer (Apache Kafka): 

	Kafka Producer 1: Handles ingestion of GPS data from vehicles and publishes it to Kafka Topic 1. 
	Kafka Producer 2: Handles video feed data, splits it into frames, associates each frame with corresponding GPS data based on timestamp, and publishes this data to Kafka Topic 2.

                                                    V
o	Real-Time Processing Layer (Apache Flink/Storm):

	Kafka Consumer 1: Subscribes to Kafka Topic 1 and consumes GPS data for real-time processing.
	Kafka Consumer 2: Subscribes to Kafka Topic 2 and consumes video feed data for real-time processing.

    				                                V
o	API Layer (Flask/Django or Spring Boot):

	Processes the output from the Real-time Processing Layer and exposes the data via RESTful APIs for consumption by the Front-End Application.

      				                                V
o	Front-End Application (React, Angular, Vue):

	Consumes data from the APIs and presents an interactive map-based interface for traffic conditions. This interface could also offer route planning features, taking into account current traffic conditions and congestion predictions
